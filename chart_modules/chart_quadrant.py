### Methods & Limitations
- This dashboard uses **Chi-Squared Tests** to evaluate whether observed differences in cyber breach rates across category intersections are statistically significant.
- Cells with **fewer than 10 total observations** are excluded from statistical testing to reduce the risk of false positives.
- For very small sample sizes, **Fisher‚Äôs Exact Test** would normally be more appropriate. However, Chi-Squared was chosen here due to the higher volume of data and speed of matrix-level testing.
- **The method used is shown in the chart tooltips and visual flags.** For example:
  - **Green triangle markers** represent statistically significant differences via **Chi-Squared**.
  - **Hover tooltips** display "Test: Chi-Squared" and the **exact p-value** for transparency.
  - (If Fisher‚Äôs Exact were used, the tooltip would state "Test: Fisher‚Äôs Exact".)
- Visual flags within the chart include:
  - **Chart legend labeled ‚ÄúChi-Squared Significant‚Äù** near the top-right quadrant.
  - Tooltip format: _‚Äú12/3 breaches\nTest: Chi-Squared\np = 0.038‚Äù_
- All insights are auto-generated from synthetic data and dynamically adjust when new data is uploaded.
