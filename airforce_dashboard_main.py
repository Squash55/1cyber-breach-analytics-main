st.markdown("""
### ü§ñ AI Insights Methods
This dashboard uses multiple forms of AI to support insight generation and decision-making:

- **Rule-Based AI**: This includes statistical methods like the Chi-Square Test of Independence to identify significant patterns in cyber breach data. For example:
    - The heatmap uses statistical tests to flag quadrants where breach rates are disproportionately high compared to expected proportions.
    - The Pareto chart highlights categories that contribute most to cyber breaches, helping prioritize mitigation efforts.

- **Generative AI (GPT)**: This provides natural language interpretations of visualizations, offering insights in a conversational tone. These GPT-generated insights complement rule-based findings by summarizing trends and suggesting actionable strategies.

Each AI output is labeled:
- üß† Rule-Based for insights derived from statistical methods.
- ü§ñ GPT-Based for generative AI explanations.

### üß™ Understanding the Chi-Square Test & P-Values

This dashboard uses the **Chi-Square Test of Independence** to assess whether the proportion of cyber breaches is significantly different in certain mission type and cyber risk level combinations.

#### üîç What does the Chi-Square Test do?
It checks whether the **distribution of breach vs. no breach** in one cell (e.g., `Combat @ Risk Level 4`) is significantly different from what we would expect **if there were no real pattern** ‚Äî just random variation.

#### üìà What is a p-value?
A **p-value** tells us how likely it is that the observed difference happened by chance.

- If `p < 0.05`, the result is **statistically significant**, meaning it's **unlikely to be random**.
- In the heatmap, you‚Äôll see green labels like `p=0.017` above certain quadrants.
- These markers indicate that the cyber breach rate in that cell is **unusually high or low** compared to the rest of the data.

#### ‚úÖ How to use this info:
- Quadrants with **p < 0.05** are flagged as **potential risk hotspots**.
- These areas are prioritized in the **Rule-Based insights** and **Golden Questions & Answers**.

    st.markdown("""
#### üßÆ The Math Behind It (Simplified)

The Chi-Square statistic compares **what we observe** in the data to **what we'd expect** if there were no relationship between mission type, cyber risk level, and breaches.

For each cell:

Where:
- **Observed** = number of breaches (or no breaches) in a specific cell.
- **Expected** = what you'd expect if breach likelihood was evenly spread across all groups.

If the **Chi¬≤ value** is large enough, it produces a **low p-value**, meaning the observed difference is statistically significant.
